# **Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning**

Understanding human movements and body postures is challenging, especially in areas like sports, healthcare, and surveillance.  

Without Human Pose Estimation, tasks like motion analysis and injury prevention become manual, slow, and prone to mistakes.  

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to address the challenge of accurately estimating human poses in diverse environments. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust system capable of identifying and mapping key body joints to predefined landmarks, thereby understanding human movement patterns in complex tasks, particularly in fields like sports, healthcare, and surveillance.
