Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning
Understanding human movements and body postures is challenging especially in areas like sports, healthcare, and surveillance. Without Human pose Estimation, task like motion analysis and injury prevention become manual, slow, and prone to mistakes.
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to address the challenge of accurately estimating human poses in diverse environments. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust system capable of identifying and mapping key body joints to predefined landmarks, thereby understanding human movement patterns in complex task, particularly in fields like sport, healthcare, and surveillance.
